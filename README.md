# rpp2cpp

This is a fun project to learn and implement a parser from scratch for hacktoberfest. I will be transpiling
[rajiniPP](https://github.com/aadhithya/rajiniPP) to C++.

This code was written when rajiniPP was at [4d866c0](https://github.com/aadhithya/rajiniPP/tree/4d866c0093a247d788163111edfa87a6f886ddc5).
