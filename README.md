# rpp-vm

This is a fun project to learn and build a interpreter and compiler from scratch for hacktoberfest.

This code was written when rajiniPP was at [4d866c0](https://github.com/aadhithya/rajiniPP/tree/4d866c0093a247d788163111edfa87a6f886ddc5).

It has a tree-walk interpreter and also a bytecode compiler and interpreter.
I was just toying around so it's kinda slow.
